# Weather App Using React

In my process of learning *React*, I decided to create a weather app

## Development Tools

* Javasript
* Sass
* React
* Axios

### `API`

The weather data was retrieved from [Openweathermap]( http://openweathermap.org/)

## Weather Images
Freely usable images were downloaded from [https://unsplash.com/](https://unsplash.com/)

## Current Progress
- [x] Basic UI prototype
- [x] Separate into react components
- [x] Call API to retrieve data
- [x] Connect API's data to components using hooks
- [ ] Create interactivity
